      <p>I developed this To Do App to practice my React and AWS skills. To begin I followed <a href="https://github.com/rochellev/ToDoApp">this</a> tutorial to make a static version of the app using React functional components and hooks. I will add other features and connect it to a database. You can see the app here, rochellecrain.com.</p>
